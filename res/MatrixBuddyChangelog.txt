Matrix Buddy is an application providing very simple matrix and vector
computations. A lot of base operations are accessible by clicking the
corresponding operator-button and entering values into the textfieds.

All results are computed immediately.

This is included in version 1:

- 2D, 3D and 4D vectors, 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.
- Most common scalar operations, vector operations matrix operations.
- Indication of result, error or warning.
- Automatic changing of result matrix/vector depending on where values were
  entered.
- Code text field for copy and pasting whole vectors and matrices.
  For Matlab, Mathematica, Maple and C in different orderings and dimensions.
- Quick help lines and a help file
- Settings: Quick Help, Labels, Tab ordering and code style
- Remembering settings
- Very simple UI
- Nice logo
