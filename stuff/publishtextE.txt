Matrix Buddy is your everyday helper when dealing with basic linear algebra: Simple operations with vector and matrix for 2D, 3D and 4D vectors and 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.

All in one single, super-easy interface. Perfect for students and developers.

Simple operations with vector and matrix for 2D, 3D and 4D vectors and 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.

Copy and paste serialized vectors and matrices as strings in various formats: C-style, Mathematica, Matlab and Maple.

What you can compute:

Note that many operations can be performed in two ways: Multiplying a matrix with a vector is one operation but when inverted, you are solving a linear equation system. A short help text on top of the operation tells you what you can do!

- Multiplication, Solving linear equation systems.
- Negation, addition and subtraction.
- Dot product (scalar product), cross product, length (2-Norm).
- Creating diagonal matrices, transposing and inverting.
- Normalizing, orthogonalizing and mirroring of vectors.
- Componentwise multiplication and division.
- Scalar multiplication and division.
